# Linux commandline client for the realtime Estonian speech recognition service
# Author: Kaarel Kaljurand
# Version: 2011-04-14
#
# Dependencies:
#	arecord/aplay, tested with 1.0.23
#	flac, tested with 1.2.1
#	curl, tested with 7.21.0
#	json_xs
#	bash, tested with 4.1.5(1)-release
#	echo
#
# Usage:
# 1. Start up: bash recognize.bash
# 2. Talk into the microphone (stop recording by pressing Ctrl-C)
# 3. (Compress into Flac)
# 4. (Optional for testing: decompress the compression and playback the result)
# 5. (Post the Flac file to the recognition server)
# 6. Look at the returned transcription (pretty-printed JSON)
#
# Two files are created into the current directory:
# raw recording (wav) and compressed recording (flac)

# Note: you can pipe the result through json_xs (or python -mjson.tool) to get it pretty-printed.
# Then you also have to hide the header (i.e. remove -i)
